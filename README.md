This is a simple Takahashi method inspired presentation tool.

It takes a plain text file as the presentation content. Each line becomes a slide. An ` _ ` seperates between a main bold line and a secondary small gray line.

To build and run this application [the Nim programming language](https://nim-lang.org/) must be installed. Then run the following in the base directory.

```
  nimble run show presentation.txt
```
